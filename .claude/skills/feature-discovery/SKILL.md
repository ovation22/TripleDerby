# Feature Discovery and Planning

## Overview
This skill guides systematic feature discovery and planning to ensure requirements are well-understood before implementation begins. It's specifically designed for planning game features in the TripleDerby horse racing simulation.

## When to Use
- Planning a new game feature or capability
- Analyzing feature requirements and scope
- Breaking down complex features into implementable tasks
- Conducting feasibility studies for new mechanics
- Designing game systems (race mechanics, betting, training, etc.)
- Scope planning for development iterations

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Discovery
1. **Gather Context**: Ask clarifying questions about feature goals, user experience, and game design intent
2. **Identify Requirements**: Document what the feature must do (functional requirements)
3. **Explore Constraints**: Understand technical, gameplay, and performance constraints
4. **Map Use Cases**: Identify player interactions and game scenarios
5. **Review Codebase**: Examine existing patterns and systems that may be affected or leveraged

### Phase 2: Technical Analysis
1. **Evaluate Feasibility**: Assess technical viability within the current architecture
2. **Identify Dependencies**: Map relationships to existing systems (Race, Horse, Betting, etc.)
3. **Review Data Model**: Consider database schema changes needed
4. **Assess Integration Points**: Identify where new code connects to existing systems
5. **Consider Performance**: Evaluate impact on race simulation, UI responsiveness, etc.
6. **Security & Validation**: Identify data validation and security requirements

### Phase 3: Planning
1. **Break Down Tasks**: Decompose the feature into concrete, implementable tasks
2. **Sequence Work**: Identify logical implementation phases and dependencies
3. **Estimate Complexity**: Note particularly complex or risky areas
4. **Create Task List**: Use TodoWrite to create a structured task breakdown
5. **Define Milestones**: Identify testable checkpoints and deliverables

### Phase 4: Documentation
1. **Write Specification**: Create clear feature requirements document
2. **Document Assumptions**: Record decisions and assumptions made during planning
3. **Define Success Criteria**: Establish how to validate the feature works correctly
4. **Create Implementation Plan**: Write step-by-step implementation approach
5. **Reference Templates**: Use PLANNING_TEMPLATE.md and DISCOVERY_CHECKLIST.md

## Examples

### Example 1: New Game System
**User**: "I want to add a horse training system where players can improve their horses' stats over time"

**Claude will**:
- Ask about training mechanics (time-based? resource-based? mini-games?)
- Explore stat progression (linear? diminishing returns? caps?)
- Review existing Horse entity and stats structure
- Identify UI requirements for training interface
- Plan database schema changes for tracking training progress
- Break down into tasks: data model, service layer, UI, validation
- Create implementation roadmap with phases

### Example 2: Race Feature Enhancement
**User**: "Design a weather system that affects race outcomes"

**Claude will**:
- Clarify weather types and their effects on racing
- Review RaceService and race simulation logic
- Identify where weather modifiers integrate into calculations
- Plan random weather generation vs player-controlled scenarios
- Consider UI for displaying weather conditions
- Document edge cases (weather changes mid-race?)
- Create phased implementation plan

### Example 3: Requirements Analysis
**User**: "Help me plan a multiplayer betting feature where players can bet on each other's races"

**Claude will**:
- Ask about betting rules, stake limits, payout calculations
- Explore multiplayer architecture requirements
- Review existing betting system (if any)
- Identify security concerns (preventing cheating, validation)
- Plan real-time updates and notifications
- Break into phases: single-player betting, then multiplayer integration
- Create comprehensive task breakdown

## Best Practices

### Discovery Phase
- Ask open-ended questions to understand the "why" behind features
- Reference similar features in the existing codebase
- Consider player experience and game balance
- Document edge cases and unusual scenarios

### Analysis Phase
- Read relevant existing code before proposing changes
- Identify patterns used elsewhere in the codebase (services, entities, repositories)
- Consider both happy path and error scenarios
- Think about testability

### Planning Phase
- Break features into vertical slices when possible (end-to-end functionality)
- Sequence tasks to deliver testable increments
- Flag high-risk or complex areas that need extra attention
- Create detailed but flexible plans

### Documentation Phase
- Write specifications that developers can implement from
- Include code examples or pseudocode for complex logic
- Reference existing patterns to follow
- Document open questions and areas needing future decisions
- **Use Mermaid for all diagrams** (architecture, flow charts, sequence diagrams, etc.)

## Output Format

After conducting discovery and planning, create a feature specification document in `/docs/features/` that includes:

1. **Feature Summary**: One-paragraph overview
2. **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
3. **Technical Approach**: Architecture and integration points
4. **Implementation Plan**: Phased task breakdown
5. **Success Criteria**: How to validate correctness
6. **Open Questions**: Items needing further clarification

Use the PLANNING_TEMPLATE.md as a starting point for documentation.

### Diagram Guidelines

**ALWAYS use Mermaid for diagrams in feature specifications:**

- **Architecture Diagrams**: Use `graph TB` (top-bottom) or `graph LR` (left-right)
  ```mermaid
  graph TB
      A[Component A] --> B[Component B]
      B --> C[Component C]
  ```

- **Sequence Diagrams**: Use `sequenceDiagram` for interaction flows
  ```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
      User->>API: Request
      API->>Service: Process
      Service-->>API: Response
      API-->>User: Result
  ```

- **State Diagrams**: Use `stateDiagram-v2` for state machines
  ```mermaid
  stateDiagram-v2
      [*] --> Pending
      Pending --> InProgress
      InProgress --> Completed
      InProgress --> Failed
  ```

- **Entity Relationships**: Use `erDiagram` for data models
  ```mermaid
  erDiagram
      HORSE ||--o{ RACE_RUN : participates
      RACE ||--o{ RACE_RUN : contains
  ```

**Benefits of Mermaid:**
- Renders directly in GitHub and markdown viewers
- Version control friendly (text-based)
- Easy to update and maintain
- No external image files needed

**Output Location**: All feature specification documents should be saved to `/docs/features/[feature-name].md`

## Integration with Existing Systems

When planning features for TripleDerby, consider integration with:
- **Core Entities**: Horse, Race, RaceRun, RaceRunHorse, Player, etc.
- **Services**: RaceService, simulation logic, game flow
- **Data Layer**: Entity Framework, repositories, ModelBuilderExtensions
- **UI**: Game interface, player controls, visual feedback
- **Game Balance**: Stats, probabilities, progression systems

## Notes

- This skill uses Read, Grep, and Glob tools to explore the codebase during discovery
- Creates task lists using TodoWrite for structured planning
- May use AskUserQuestion to clarify ambiguous requirements
- Produces markdown documentation for feature specifications
- Focuses on practical, implementable plans rather than theoretical designs

## CRITICAL GIT WORKFLOW RULES

**NEVER commit or push code without EXPLICIT user approval.**

When implementing features:
1. **Discovery Phase**: Research, design, document - NO git commands
2. **Implementation Phase**: Write code, run tests - NO git commits
3. **WAIT for user approval**: User must explicitly say "commit this" or "push this"
4. **ONLY THEN**: Create commits and push to remote

**Examples of what NOT to do:**
- ❌ "Let me commit Phase 1" (without asking first)
- ❌ Automatically committing after tests pass
- ❌ Assuming user wants code committed

**Correct workflow:**
- ✅ Implement feature
- ✅ Run tests to verify
- ✅ Report results to user
- ✅ ASK: "Would you like me to commit these changes?"
- ✅ WAIT for explicit approval
- ✅ ONLY THEN run git commands

## COMMIT AND PR MESSAGE RULES

**NEVER include Claude Code attribution or self-reference in commits or PRs.**

When creating commits or pull requests:
- ❌ NEVER add "🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]" footer
- ❌ NEVER add "Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet" tag
- ❌ NEVER mention Claude, AI, or automated generation
- ✅ Write commit messages as if written by the developer
- ✅ Focus on what changed and why
- ✅ Use professional, technical language only

**Examples:**

**BAD - DO NOT DO THIS:**
```
Feature implementation complete

This adds the new commentary system.

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**GOOD - DO THIS:**
```
Feature implementation complete

This adds the new commentary system with event detection
and natural language variation.
```
